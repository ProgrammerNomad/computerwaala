            <h2>Upfront Savings</h2>
            <p>

              For startup businesses, cash is everything. That’s why it’s so important to save money now while cash is tight. By renting computers, your upfront costs are much lower than if you were to buy them. When you buy, each computer can cost hundreds, even thousands of rupees. When you rent, you only pay a fraction of that cost in the beginning.
