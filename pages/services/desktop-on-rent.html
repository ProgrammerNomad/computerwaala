            <h2>Upfront Savings</h2>
            <p>

              For startup businesses, cash is everything. That’s why it’s so important to save money now while cash is tight. By renting computers, your upfront costs are much lower than if you were to buy them. When you buy, each computer can cost hundreds, even thousands of rupees. When you rent, you only pay a fraction of that cost in the beginning.

            <h2>Use the most current models</h2>
            <p>
              The technology with computers is always moving forward. As soon as you walk out of the store with yours, it’s pretty much outdated. The good thing about renting is that you can always swap your computers out for the latest models. This ensures your company is always on the cutting edge, using the latest available technology.
